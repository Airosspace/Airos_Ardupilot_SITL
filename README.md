# Ardupilot SITL for Ubuntu 20.04

ArduPilot SITL (Software in the Loop) is a software simulation of the ArduPilot firmware running on a simulated vehicle or drone. It allows developers to test and debug their code without the need for a physical vehicle. The simulation is accurate and mimics the real-world environment, enabling developers to test their code in a safe and controlled environment. The ArduPilot SITL can be run on a variety of platforms, including Linux, Windows, and Mac. It can simulate a variety of vehicles, including quadcopters, airplanes, and rovers. The simulation can be controlled using a ground control station (GCS).


## Installation

### Clone ArduPilot

In home directory:
```
cd ~
sudo apt install git
git clone https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot.git
cd ardupilot
```

### Install dependencies:
```
cd ardupilot
Tools/environment_install/install-prereqs-ubuntu.sh -y
```

reload profile
```
. ~/.profile
```
### If the next step "git submodule update" fails
```
git config --global url.https://.insteadOf git://
```

### Checkout Latest Copter Build
```
git checkout Copter-4.0.4
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Run SITL (Software In The Loop) once to set params:
```
cd ~/ardupilot/ArduCopter
sim_vehicle.py -w
```


## Usage 

ArduPilot SITL can be run on a variety of platforms, including Linux, Windows, and Mac. To use ArduPilot SITL, you will need to follow these steps:

- Install ArduPilot firmware on your computer using the instructions provided on the ArduPilot website.
- Install a ground control station (GCS) such as Mission Planner or QGroundControl on your computer.
- Configure the ArduPilot SITL to simulate the vehicle you want to test.
- Run the simulation using the GCS.




## Features
ArduPilot SITL provides several features that make it a powerful tool for developers. These features include:

- Accurate simulation of the real-world environment: ArduPilot SITL uses a physics engine to simulate the vehicle's movements and interactions with the environment. The physics engine takes into account factors such as gravity, wind, and air resistance.
- Simulation of sensors: ArduPilot SITL simulates the vehicle's sensors, such as GPS, accelerometers, and gyroscopes. This allows developers to test their code with realistic sensor data.
- Support for multiple vehicles: ArduPilot SITL can simulate a variety of vehicles, including quadcopters, airplanes, and rovers.
- Support for multiple platforms: ArduPilot SITL can be run on a variety of platforms, including Linux, Windows, and Mac.
- Real-time testing: ArduPilot SITL allows developers to test their code in real-time, without the need for a physical vehicle.
- Safe and controlled environment: ArduPilot SITL provides a safe and controlled environment for testing and debugging code.It allows developers to test their code without the risk of damaging a physical vehicle.

Overall, ArduPilot SITL is a powerful tool for developers who want to test and debug their code in a safe and controlled environment. It provides an accurate simulation of the real-world environment and allows developers to test their code with realistic sensor data.
